1) Centralized Systems
-----------

Centralized system example and explain

> Pros and Cons

 - Points of failure and maintenance
 - Fault Tolerance / Stability
 - Scalability / Max Population
 - Ease of development / Creation

2) Need of decentralized Systems:
----------

 - Issues in world of software is security and transparency in trust.
 - Ease of transferring assets and amounts. 
 - Accounting and auditing.
 - Immutable

Explain how a decentralized system will work with example

Issues with Fiat currencies and exchanges

3) Rise of cryptocurrencies
-----

Explain the concept of fiat currencies and why we need common universal currencies.

Explain paypal.

Explain about bitcoin and other crypto currencies and usages and market share.

Explain grcoin.

How difficult to start a own bank and implementing account system.

How cryptocurrencies and created.

This cryptocurrencies are created using secure crypto graphic protocols.

This technology which is powering the cryptocurrencies is called Blockchain Technology.

How cryptocurrencies work. And What is Blockchain ?
--------

You might have heard about shared ledger, secured ledger, everyone is having same data.

In bitcoin, everyone can see others balance using their address.

Now you may ask what is address. It is kind of username. Whoever wants to open an account in bitcoin it can be done in 10 seconds. How easy is in't.

For example we can connect to the bitcoin network using the client software which is open source.

Like to get use the youtube service we will be installing the Youtube app in our mobiles.

Once bitcoin client installed in our machine, we can create a bit coin account. Like we can create youtube account.

Here the our account in bitcoin is bitcoin address it is used as account.

To access our account we use our password. But in bitcoin to access we need our private key.

Okey what is private key, for every account in bitcoin, it consists of public key and private key. Public key is the last 20 characters of the private key.

In cryptography, any msg is signed with a private key can be validated with public key which is signed using the correct private key.This is how security is created in bitcoin.

This is the base concept of Blockchain technology. Every account will have public key and corresponding private key.

But in bitcoin case we are only transferring bitcoins from one account from another account. But we can transact anything digital data in blockchain.

How bitcoin and blockchain works.

Explain the bitcoin transaction, and blockchain terminologies

speak about all the terms in the blockchain
transaction.

Advantages of Blockchain
-----------
Disintermediation & trustless exchange 
Empowered users 
High quality data 
Durability, reliability, and longevity 
Process integrity 
Transparency and immutability 
Ecosystem simplification 
Faster transactions
Lower transaction costs

Nascent technology 
Uncertain regulatory status
Large energy consumption 
Control, security, and privacy 
Integration concerns 
Cultural adoption 
Cost 

Explain buying and selling platform in blockchain.

Develop an Blockchain Application
-------------

To develop an blockchain applications we have multiple platforms

Platform Available
----------
 1. Ethereum
 2. Corda
 3. Hyperledger
 4. Hyperledger Fabric
 5. Eris
 6. Hydrachain
 7. Multichain
 8. etc

Today we are gonna explain about the ethereum network.

1. Public Blockchain
2. Private Blockchain( Permissioned or consortium blockchain).

And most of the enterprise applications we will be using the private networks.

To create the private network.

Download the ethereum clients

http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/

The most people using go-ethereum client, geth clients.

After installing ethereum and geth clients.

Open a command prompt. type geth

we can various options

create a datadir where our blockchain data will get download and to store our keystore files.

after started we can go and attach it to rpc attach so that we can interact with blockchain network.

Okey how to use it with web and mobile apps, so we have the web3 channel to connect to the ethereum blockchain network.

Another important aspect of ethereum network is smart contracts, through that we can store and retreive data.

solidity programming

Simple set and get smart contracts running in the network, speaing about the network mining.

Technology stack is 
-----
Any frontend framework
+
Ethereum(Smart Contract)
+
Any blockchain based DB
